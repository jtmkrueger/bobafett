### tl;dr
Kills processes, users and files.

Usage
=====

Applications freeze up. 

Servers become unresponsive. 

Sometimes you just want to get rid of an unwanted user or compromising files.

All you need to do is ask the most notorious bounty hunter in the galaxy to take care of it for you.

You'll need to clone the repo then move `bobafett` somewhere in your path. I keep him in `/usr/local/bin` .
You can either add the zsh function to your zshrc.



Thanks
------

I would like to thank Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike for writing ***The Unix Programming Environment***. It was a fantastic introduction to unix and the shell. Without it I would not have thought to write this command.
