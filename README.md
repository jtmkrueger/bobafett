### tl;dr
It's an alias for pkill.

Usage
=====

Applications freeze up. 

Servers become unresponsive. 

All the sudden, your machine slows way down and you have to get rid of the offending process.

All you need to do is ask the most notorious bounty hunter in the galaxy to take care of it for you.

```
~$ bobafett chrome
As you wish.
~$
```

Done. The Chrome process is dead. He's efficient and quick.


Installation
============

You'll need to clone the repo then move `bobafett` somewhere in your path. I keep him in `/usr/local/bin`



Thanks
------

I would like to thank Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike for writing ***The Unix Programming Environment***. It was a fantastic introduction to unix and the shell. Without it I would not have thought to write this command.
