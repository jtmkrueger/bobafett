Usage
=====

Applications freeze up. 

Servers become unresponsive. 

All the sudden, your machine slows way down and you have to get rid of the offending process.

All you need to do is ask the most notorious bounty hunter in the galaxy.

```
~$ bobafett chrome
As you wish.
~$
```

Done. The Chrome process that was using the most memory is dead. He's effecient and quick.


Installation
============

You'll need to clone the repo then move `bobafett` somewhere in your path. I keep him in `/usr/local/bin`



Thanks
------

I would like to thank Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike for writing ***The Unix Programming Environment***. It was a fantastic introduction to unix and the shell. Without it I would not have thought to write this command.
